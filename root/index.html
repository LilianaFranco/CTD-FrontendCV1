        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm a lifelong learner and I'm not afraid of challenges. I listen to ideas, I ask questions, I facilitate discussions and I identify solutions.
            As a Scrum Master, I believe Improving people's relationships with each other amplifies their ability to overcome challenges. As a professional Translator, I value the role of communication in every human interaction. Finally, as a human being, I believe respect and love for everything and everyone that surrounds us make our life complete.
            During my career, Iâ€™ve worked as an English to Spanish translator, as an instructional designer to create online courses, and as a scrum master in software development projects, a position I really enjoy right now, since it allows me to continue learning every day. I'm also a volunteer in Women Who Code, an international non-profit organization that provides services for women pursuing technology careers.
            Therefore, I possess excellent time management skills, a great ability to work under pressure, and patience to solve conflicts.
